## Netlify Functions Template

- Write your Netlify Functions in the /netlify/functions folder, there is an example one to build from there.

- You can deliver json files inside in the json folder in public (you can move it elsewhere if you want)

- Netlify.toml sets the access headers that would apply to the json files, for the functions you have specify the access headers for each function, they are commented out in the example one.
